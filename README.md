# Web_BLE_ESP32_360Visualisation
A phone takes 360 pictures of an object, turned by a stepper motor.
The phone communicates with the stepper motor driven by a esp32 over web ble.
A flask web app controls everything and takes the pictures automatically and saves them locally on the PC which hosts the flask app.
